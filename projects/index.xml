&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rising.farm/play&#34;&gt;Rising Farms Online&lt;/a&gt; is the biggest project I’ve been working on. It started in late 2009 / early 2010 and lasts until now. Starting with a Visual Basic 6 application I’ve done several rewritings of the codebase where I’ve learned so many things like different programming languages and design patterns. It was my playground where I could do what I want - and I wanted to build an extraordinary game experience. That’s why i put so much effort into &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34; title=&#34;Rising Farms Online&#34;&gt;RFO&lt;/span&gt;. This project contributes a major part to my coding experience and is the reason why I’m the software engineer I am today.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aB1j0G4NdMg?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;What is it about?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know Harvest Moon? It is a farmsimulation with RPG elements, first released in 1996 for the SNES. I loved playing “HM: Friends of Mineral Town” on my Gameboy Advance. Early 2010 I’ve searched the web for an online version of this type of game, but there was no “Harvest Moon Online” out there. That’s when it came to my mind: why not creating your own &lt;span class=&#34;tooltip&#34; title=&#34;Harvest Moon&#34;&gt;HM&lt;/span&gt; Online?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;image-link&#34; href=&#34;../../images/risingfarms_1.png&#34; title=&#34;Login Screen&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#39;http://seriousco.de/images/risingfarms_1.png&#39;
      class=&#39;right round-rectangle&#39; 
    style=&#39; width:300px; &#39;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
Rising Farms Online is a multiplayer farmsimulation where you can interact with other players and npcs. Every player has his own farm where he can plant seeds, care for his animals and do a lot of other fun stuff. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to create just another Farmville clone where you just click around and don’t really interact with others. In RFO the players can leave their farm and interact with each other in “Colona”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colona is a nice town with many possibilities and nice dwellers. Do you want to go mining? Test your new fishing rod? Or just want to sell your harvest at the auction house? No problem! Go out and have a nice chat with the npcs, they might have an exciting quest for you. ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenge&#34;&gt;What was the challenge?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create an online game they said. It will be easy they said. Ha! I know it would be quite a challenge, but it really was so much fun to see my idea growing up to a game worth playing. 2013 I’ve rebuilt RFO from scratch with web technologies. Everything is written in JavaScript and the users don’t have to install a client on their pc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project contributes a major part to my coding experience and is the reason why I’m the software engineer I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;image-link&#34; href=&#34;../../images/risingfarms_2.png&#34; title=&#34;Map Editor&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#39;http://seriousco.de/images/risingfarms_2.png&#39;
      class=&#39;left round-rectangle&#39; 
    style=&#39; width:300px; &#39;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
RFO basically consists of three components: The game client, the server and the editor. On the client side, informations from the server get rendered onto a html5 canvas element with WebGL. The server is built with nodejs and all the data is stored in a mongodb. The editor is for creating game content: from creating maps to adding items and whole game events - it’s a powerful tool built with angular in the frontend and nodejs in the backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RFO also improved my skills in team leading. A lot of people helped me with this project and sometimes it was a challenge coordinating them. Building a community and serving them well was also a nice experience, but as I said - I had some people helping me with this type of work. :)  I am very thankful for them, they volunteered to help me and I will mention them in a separate blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really proud of what I’ve achieved since 2010. I’ve gained so much coding experience and all the codebase refactorings and experiments were so helpful for me to become the software engineer I am today. Since I am working as a full time developer, I don&amp;rsquo;t have much time for RFO in my spare time, but I plan to move forward with this project as good as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve told so far is only a little part of what happened behind the scenes, that’s why I’m gonna release a detailed blog entry soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Driving License Trainer</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;image-link&#34; href=&#34;../../images/driving_license_trainer_1.png&#34; title=&#34;Driving License Trainer&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#39;http://seriousco.de/images/driving_license_trainer_1.png&#39;

&lt;/a&gt;
It was back in 2013, when I did my military service at the austrian armed forces and started learning for my driving license test. I was in a small office with a friend of mine and we had much spare time which we could spend as we like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the time I spent with my baby &lt;a href=&#34;../risingfarms-online&#34;&gt;Rising Farms Online&lt;/a&gt;, but I also wanted to achieve my driving license while I was at the army because I knew I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have as much free time later on when I will be working full time as a software developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay I had to learn and I wanted to arrange it as comfortable as possible - that was the moment when it came to my mind: why not code my own driving license trainer? So I could improve my coding skillz and learn for the test at the same time and hey - what&amp;rsquo;s more motivating than learning with your own piece of software? :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;What is it about?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;image-link&#34; href=&#34;../../images/driving_license_trainer.png&#34; title=&#34;Scorepoint System&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#39;http://seriousco.de/images/driving_license_trainer.png&#39;
      class=&#39;right round-rectangle&#39; 
    style=&#39; width:300px; &#39;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
Driving License Trainer is a nodejs application which helps you learning for the theory part (Austria specific) of your driving license test. It is written in javascript, makes use of the express framework and renders html with jade templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The look and feel of the application is very similiar to the official test software because I wanted to get used to it while learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the most important feature is the scorepoint system. For each question you have a scorepoint saved in a separate file. Fill out the right answers for a question and a scorepoint will be added to it. If you choose the wrong answers, the scorepoint of the question will be reset to zero. My goal was to bring all categories/questions to at least scorepoint 4 so i could be sure to know as much questions as possible when I do the real test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenge&#34;&gt;What was the challenge?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some luck I can fetch the questions from their server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the toughest problems was to get the official questions for the driving license test. After some googling I stumbled upon the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oeamtc.at/portal/fuehrerscheintest&#34;&gt;ÖAMTC online test&lt;/a&gt; and saw that they are working with the right set of questions. It was an online test written in JavaScript - &amp;ldquo;with some luck I can fetch the questions from their server&amp;rdquo; I thought. After some time examining the source code I found where they serve the content files - each question as a single json file named by the question number - beginning by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how many questions they provided exactly, so i wrote a nodejs script which tries to fetch the json files from 1.json to xxx.json. You can find this script in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dsumer/driving-license-trainer&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-github&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; of this project. I ended up with around 2000 questions - very nice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also some other information which could be fetched like the images of every question and the type of the test. After fetching all the data needed, I started implementing the main logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;admonition note&#34;&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;admonition-title&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the project on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dsumer/driving-license-trainer&#34;&gt;&lt;i class=&#34;fa fa-github&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Driving License Trainer was a small project which helped me learning and improving my coding skills. With the project I gathered experience with the express framework and it gave me a better know-how of nodejs overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to use the driving license trainer on your own! Unfortunately I can&amp;rsquo;t assure that the questions are correct. Many questions have changed since 2013 and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if ÖAMTC has kept their questions up-to-date. Anyways, you can try to run the refresh.js script to fetch the newest questions from the ÖAMTC server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ cd ~/driving-license-trainer/public/data
$ node refresh.js
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
